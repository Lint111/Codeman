# Codeman agent base image (built locally by scripts/build-agent-image.mjs).
#
# Contains the agent toolchain (node + the CLIs + git/tmux/ripgrep) but NO
# secrets: credentials are delivered at RUNTIME via bind mounts (~/.claude etc.)
# or name-only `docker exec --env`, never baked in, so `docker save` exports stay
# secret-free. tmux is a HARD prerequisite (the in-container tmux is what makes a
# reconnect durable), so it is installed here and probed before launch.
#
# HOME is made writable by an ARBITRARY host uid via the OpenShift "gid 0,
# group-writable" convention: on Linux we run `--user <hostUid>:0`, so the agent
# uid is the host uid (workspace files stay host-owned) while gid 0 keeps $HOME
# writable even though the uid is not the baked 1000.

# Base toolchain. `curl` is needed for the hook callbacks (`curl -sk $CODEMAN_API_URL`),
# `procps` for `ps`, `tmux` for the durable in-container session.

# Antigravity (`agy`) is NOT on npm — Google ships a standalone binary through its

# root's home and would be unreachable by the `agent` user the container runs as.

# `agent` user (gid 0) with an arbitrary-uid-writable HOME. The uid is
# auto-assigned (node:22-slim already occupies uid 1000 with its `node` user); at
# runtime Codeman overrides with `--user <hostUid>:0` on Linux, so the baked uid
# only matters for a hand-run / Docker Desktop container. gid 0 + group-writable
# HOME (OpenShift arbitrary-uid convention) keeps $HOME writable for any uid.
# UTF-8 locale so tmux/Ink render Unicode box-drawing instead of VT100 ACS `q`

# transcript/rollout dirs (`.claude/projects`, `.codex/sessions`) are bind-mounted from
# the host. (gemini/gcloud/opencode are whole seed-copies and need no pre-created dir;
# Antigravity nests its state inside `.gemini/antigravity-cli`, so it rides that seed.)
