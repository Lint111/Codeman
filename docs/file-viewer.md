# File Viewer

The File Viewer is a session-scoped repository browser for files, current Git
changes, and commit history. Its browser UI lives in
`src/web/public/panels-ui.js`; file and repository HTTP routes live in
`src/web/routes/file-routes.ts`; Git command/parsing logic lives in
`src/git-repository-browser.ts`.

## Views

- **Files** lists the selected scope's directory tree and opens the existing
  file preview for text, images, audio/video, PDF, SVG, and Office documents.
- **Changes** lists the selected worktree's current staged, unstaged, and
  untracked paths. It refreshes every five seconds only while the panel and
  Changes tab are visible.
- **History** lists the latest 30 commits. Expanding a commit lazily loads its
  changed paths; selecting a path lazily loads that file's patch and snapshots.
- **Compact diff** renders unified-diff hunks. **Full diff** renders the whole
  after-file, highlights additions, and inserts deleted hunk rows at their
  corresponding anchors. Deleted files use the before-file.

## Session And Worktree Scope

The selected session remains the ownership boundary. For a Git-backed session:

1. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` maps a nested `session.workingDir` to the
   current worktree root.
2. `git worktree list --porcelain -z` discovers the main repository worktree
   and its linked worktrees.
3. The File Viewer defaults to the selected session's current worktree root.
   The selector exposes the main/root worktree and every linked worktree.
4. The browser sends only a short scope ID. On every scoped request, the server
   rediscovers the repository and accepts the ID only when it exactly matches a
   current worktree entry.

For a non-Git session, `scope=current` falls back to `session.workingDir` and
Changes/History report that Git is unavailable.

On startup, tmux recovery reads `#{pane_current_path}` with the pane PID. Newly
discovered local sessions use that path instead of the Codeman server's process
directory. Local metadata written by the older process-directory fallback is
self-healed when the saved path still equals `process.cwd()`. Tracked remote and
Docker sessions retain their persisted execution metadata.

The pencil action in the File Viewer header lets the user synchronize an
already-running local session with a different host work path. Applying it
updates `Session.workingDir`, mux recovery metadata, Bash path resolution,
Ralph's plan watcher, image watching, and persisted/SSE session state. It does
not change the cwd of the running child process. Remote and Docker sessions are
excluded because a host-only metadata edit cannot coherently change their
execution roots.

Unscoped file URLs retain the original `session.workingDir` confinement. This
is load-bearing for attachments and existing API consumers: repository
discovery must not silently broaden every session file route.

### Subagent Context

Selecting a dispatched subagent in Codeman's subagent panel, or focusing its
floating window, temporarily changes the File Viewer context without mutating
the parent `Session.workingDir`. Claude transcript entries provide the
subagent's absolute `cwd`; the watcher retains it as `SubagentInfo.workingDir`.
The browser sends the opaque `agentId` with File Viewer requests, and the
server resolves that ID through the watcher-owned metadata before applying the
normal worktree scope and user-space checks. Client-supplied filesystem paths
are never accepted as a substitute.

Recovered mux sessions use runtime IDs such as `restored-7148e9de`, while the
provider transcript retains the full UUID beginning with `7148e9de`. Codeman
recognizes that minimum eight-character restored prefix as the same parent;
ordinary sessions still require an exact conversation ID, so another
conversation in the same repository is rejected.

The File Viewer context key is `(sessionId, agentId)`. This key participates in
request cancellation, stale-response checks, commit caches, repository
polling, previews, and downloads. Selecting the parent tab, clicking the
parent name in a subagent window, or minimizing the focused subagent restores
the parent session context and its configured work path. Restoring floating
windows after startup does not implicitly change File Viewer focus.

Provider integrations can use the same contract when their subagent registry
exposes a stable agent ID, parent-session association, and server-observed
absolute workspace. Providers must not pass an arbitrary workspace from the
browser.

## HTTP API

All routes require access to the owning session through `findSessionOrFail`.
File Viewer routes accept an optional `agentId`; when present, its
server-resolved workspace becomes the base before the existing `scope`
resolution runs.

| Route                                                                   | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `PUT /api/sessions/:id/working-directory`                               | Synchronize a local session's host work path   |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/repository?scope=`                               | Worktrees, current changes, recent commits     |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/repository/commit?scope=&commit=`                | One commit and its changed paths               |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/repository/diff?scope=&path=&commit=`            | Lazy patch plus bounded before/after snapshots |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/files?...&scope=`                                | Directory tree rooted at a validated worktree  |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/file-{content,raw,preview,thumbnail}?...&scope=` | Existing preview routes in that same scope     |

Git is executed with `spawn()` argument arrays, no shell, optional locks
disabled, a ten-second timeout, and bounded stdout/stderr. Patches are capped at
2 MiB and marked truncated. Before/after text snapshots are capped at 1 MiB;
binary files are detected before decoding. File paths are normalized, confined
to the selected worktree, and realpath-checked before working-tree reads.

Git status uses porcelain v2 with NUL delimiters and explicit rename detection.
Git still models an unstaged delete plus an untracked destination as separate
changes; it can report a rename once the move exists in the index. Do not add
client-side filename/similarity guessing.

## Client Lifecycle

`loadFileBrowser()` owns an `AbortController` and monotonically increasing
generation. A response may paint only when its generation, session ID,
subagent ID, and active tab still match. This prevents a slower previous
session or subagent from replacing the selected context's tree or repository
state.

Switching sessions synchronously changes File Viewer ownership and resets scope
to `current` before terminal resize/history loading begins. An open viewer
starts loading the new repository immediately; a closed viewer invalidates its
old repository state without issuing a request. Reopening then loads the active
session. The selected Files/Changes/History view is preserved. Manual refresh
preserves filters and expanded folders. Closing the panel aborts its request
and stops repository polling.

A successful work-path edit and a work-path change received through
`session:updated` use the same forced invalidation. The selected scope resets to
`current`, in-flight requests are aborted, and an open viewer reloads once.

On phones, the opt-in File Viewer header button remains available and opens a
safe-area-aware bottom sheet. Diff preview uses the full visual viewport.

## Focused Tests

- `test/git-repository-browser.test.ts`: real temporary repository and linked
  worktree, nested discovery, status/history/diffs, rename parsing, and scope
  traversal rejection.
- `test/routes/file-routes-repository.test.ts`: session route ownership and
  scoped-vs-legacy file access, including owned and foreign subagent contexts.
- `test/mobile/file-viewer.test.ts`: stale tab-switch response rejection,
  parent/subagent context restoration, worktree selector defaults, Changes and
  History interactions, compact/full diff rendering, and phone viewport
  bounds.
